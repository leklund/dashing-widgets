Some widgets for Dashing

1. Datetime - a widget to show the current date and time from three timezones.
   Heavily inspired by the clock widget from Braniac.
2. Weather Plus - show weather from yahoo weather API. Uses weather-icons (http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)
   and includes a (simple) moonphase calculator and sunrise/sunset display using ruby-sun-times gem.
